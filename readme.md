Main goals of this library:

1) to have a TCP connection
2) at the same time stil to be able to initiate/answer GSM calls
3) ability to send modem replies to AT commands back to TCP connection
4) DTMF tone generating and detection

It was (and still is) a part of one of my programs, now I'm extracting it as a library.

PIN codes should be disabled
