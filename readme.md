vSIM900

Custom SIM900 library.
Main goals of this library to:
1) have TCP connection
2) at the same time stil be able to initiate/answer GSM calls
3) ability to send modem replies back to TCP connection
4) DTMF tone generating and detection

It was (and still is) a part of one of my programs, just now I'm extracting it as a library.
